# AutosteerPCBv2LB
forked from  mnltake/AutosteerPCBv2LB

This is a porting of mnltake's lightbar code to the latest version of the AgOpenGPS machine code (4.3.10).

*my_settings Branch*

Note - this branch has modifications specific to my hardware (such as pin number changes, using an ST Nucleo 32 board instead of an Arduino Nano, custom IMU implementation etc.). I recommend that you stick the Master branch that is as close to the standard 4.3.10 .INO as possible!
